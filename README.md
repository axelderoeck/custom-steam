# Custom Steam skin

This skin hides certain aspects of the Steam client that I dislike.

## Notes
Remove lines in webkit.css that you don't need.

## Installation
1. Drag and drop the folder ```custom``` inside ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\skins```.

> You can create the folder 'skins' if this doesn't exist.

2. Start/restart Steam.
3. Steam settings -> Interface -> Select the skin you wish Steam to use (requires Steam to restart). 
4. Select ```custom```.
5. Restart Steam.
